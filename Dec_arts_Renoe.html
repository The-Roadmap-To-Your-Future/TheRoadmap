        <p>
        In an ideal world, we’d be able to pursue the careers we’re passionate about in order to create sustainable, meaningful ways of living. For many in the humanities and arts fields, however—especially aspiring performing artists—the reality is that a high-paying job that serves interest well hardly comes by. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Yet for piano accompanists such as Mr. Craig Renoe, passion and career blend to create meaning. As a piano accompanist based in New Jersey, Mr. Renoe’s work entails playing accompaniment for rehearsals and recitals in both The Lawrenceville School and The College of New Jersey. For example, Mr. Renoe plays annually for the Lawrenceville fall musical, Midday music concert series, and Broadway Cabaret. Additionally, he accompanies the Lawrentians and Lawrenceville Singers choir and TCNJ music juries. According to Mr. Renoe, a very important aspect of his work as an accompanist is “to support students as they learn their parts” by being familiar with the “vocal music” and tuning in “to the nuances of each performer” as he makes musical choices on the piano. By being familiar with the parts of his fellow young musicians and the manner in which the accompaniment blends with them to serve the piece, Mr. Renoe strives to “prepare a performance which will hopefully share some element of beauty and truth with the audience.”
        </p>

        <p>
        Mr. Renoe’s curiosity for being a piano accompanist sparked in his freshman year of high school after taking a “piano elective course.” As a sophomore, he assisted his local church by accompanying during “Sunday worship service,” and it was during this time that his high school orchestra teacher encouraged him to take private piano lessons. This led him to pursue a “music major” at the “Westminster Choir College,” a music conservatory of Rider University in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, that fosters a “supportive, diverse, community-focused, and non-competitive environment”—where students “perform on the professional level in acclaimed ensembles, including the prestigious Westminster Symphonic Choir.” After graduating college, Mr. Renoe began his “early career” by “teaching lessons,” but later played accompaniment for “a school district in North Dakota” and started his “first full-time job.” For him, although this job entailed “quite a bit of ‘on-the-go learning’,” Mr. Renoe’s work as an accompanist allowed him to realize that it’s possible to “make a living” by doing and exploring the music he loves. 
        </p>

        <p>
        For Mr. Renoe, an incredibly exciting aspect of being a piano accompanist that brings about “endless rewards” is “the process of preparing a new piece of music from the first rehearsal to the eventual performance.” Playing for so many different groups and occasions means that piano accompanists encounter a wide array of pieces across diverse genres, construing little “rote repetition” as “every piece poses its own unique challenges.” Furthermore, the “collaborative” nature of piano accompanist is very important for Mr. Renoe, as “working with so many different musicians” from all backgrounds and experiences, “ranging from beginner students to seasoned professionals,” brings him “great joy.” In the music world, experiences are never hierarchical; every individual has their own story to tell, thus making every opportunity artists get to learn from each other uniquely golden.
        </p>

        <p>
        As Mr. Renoe looks back on his career, he stresses the importance of collaboration and treating music as “an interpersonal endeavor.” “Pianists spend a lot of time by themselves in practice rooms honing their craft,” he explains, “but sometimes it’s important to detach yourself from this and make music with other people.” Refraining from isolation of one’s private music experience also helps foster “opportunities for collaborative performances,” which is something Mr. Renoe emphasizes the necessity of during the early stages of developing a music career. Not only can musicians be inspired to take action when voices combine in the practice room, but they can also learn a lot through seeking advice and working with “professionals already in the field.” 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        According to Mr. Renoe, it’s also crucial to let action and practice fulfill skill. “Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good–perfectionism that inhibits the willingness to try is not helpful. Be willing to make some mistakes along the way, because there is no growth without learning from mistakes.” For piano accompanists, this is especially true; since accompanists are exposed to an intense level of stop-and-go playing, familiarity with the score in both the broader sense and refined details is a no-brainer. The only way that this familiarity can be achieved is through constant rehearsal, without letting the imperfections that shape the “on-the-fly” characteristic of accompanying impede progress.
        </p>

        <p>
        Lastly, if there’s one key takeaway Mr. Renoe could give to students, it’s to “find something you are truly passionate about and pursue it.” In a world today that puts pressure on developing adolescents to stick with jobs that render achievement or wage as the best fruit, we forget to “cherish the memories of the process” and give in to the “temptation to ignore our passion in favor of a more conventional career path.” But careers exist to highlight each one of our special talents and one-of-a-kind contribution to society. Even if a job’s sole purpose is to sustain life, what does simply chasing material gratification in a job suggest about the type of person and lifestyle we chase? 
        </p> 
        
        <p>
        As Mr. Renoe puts it best, “It’s been said that if you love your job, you never work a day in your life.” Perhaps “piano accompanist” isn’t the most thrilling-sounding title of a job or everybody’s cup of tea, its existence asserts the possibility that happiness and vocational success—both of which humans strive to balance—coexist. “There is always an element of uncertainty when you are daring to form your own path, but don’t be afraid to pursue a career because you don’t have every step figured out yet.” Just like how Mr. Renoe encourages countless young artists to find their “workless” jobs with each delicate, graceful note he accompanies, sustainable success doesn’t occur overnight. It’s the result of time, testing different options, and willingness to tinker—until one day, we find the jury that satisfies our story.
